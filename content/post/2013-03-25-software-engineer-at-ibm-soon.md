I noticed that this blog has been seeing some more traffic and I have had a few questions.

I also noticed that I never mentioned that I had received a full time offer with IBM at the Mass Lab in Littleton, MA. I am excited to graduate and begin my career at the end of May with IBM!

So, for those looking to work there this summer as an intern or as a full time hire, I hope you decide to join and that you enjoy it as much as I have! Of course, any questions regarding my experience as an IBM intern or more specific questions about the Littleton area/Mass lab are welcome.
