GPA: 3.78 Graduation Date: May 2013

Profile Honors student with a thirst for knowledge and experience in business, web technologies, and software development. I am currently entering my senior year of the CNS program at Ferris State University and have made the dean’s list each semester I have attended. In my senior year of high school, I started a technology services business, PlzGeek.com, and have been creating websites, repairing computers, and developing/implementing technology solutions since. During high school, I attended the Math Science Technology Center where I spent half the day learning in advanced classes at Ferris State University. During my time at the MSTC, I won the area science fair and participated in the ISEF at Albuquerque New Mexico with a computer science project involving reinforcement learning.
